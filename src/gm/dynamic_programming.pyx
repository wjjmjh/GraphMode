    Description:
    A function that takes a generated distance matrix from a Graph object, and applies the
    Floyd-Warshall Algorithm and dynamic programming to find the shortest path.

    Input parameters:
    dist_matrix: A dictionary that represents a distance matrix;
    src_vertex: an Integer ID of a specified vertex as the source;
    dest_vertex: an Integer ID of a specified vertex as the destination;

    Return:
    an array of vertices that represents the shortest path between the source vertex and the
    destination vertex.
