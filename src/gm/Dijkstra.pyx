def Dijkstra_to_find_shortest_distances():

    Description:
    A function that invokes the Heap object as the data structure to perform the
    Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest distances from a specified source vertex to other
    vertices on a given graph;

    Input parameters:
    graph: a Graph object that contains essential data and methods;
    src_vertex: an integer ID of a specified source vertex that would be used to calculate
    shortest paths from other vertices to this vertex.â€¢

    Return:
    A dictionary that has "destination_vertex" as its keys and "shortest_distance_from_source"
    as its values.

def influence_of_a_vertex():

    Description:
    A function that invokes function dynamic_programming_to_find_the_shortest_distances to
    compute the influence of a vertex to the graph by finding the average of the distances of shortest paths of the graph
    before and after the removal of the vertex.

    Input parameters:
    graph: a Graph object that contains essential data and methods;
    vertex: an Integer ID of a specified vertex as the interested;

    Return: a number that represents the influence of the input vertex.
